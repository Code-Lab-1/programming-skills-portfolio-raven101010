#A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

#* Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store 

#their meanings as values.

#* Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print 

#the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between 

#each word-meaning pair in your output.
